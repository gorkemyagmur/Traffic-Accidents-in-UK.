# Traffic-Accidents-in-UK.
This study was conducted for the Final Case of Türk Telekom &amp; TRAI Veri Bilimi ve  Analitiği Practicum.

# About Dataset

## Context

The UK government amassed traffic data from 2000 and 2016, recording over 1.6 million accidents in the process and making this one of the most comprehensive traffic data sets out there. It's a huge picture of a country undergoing change.

Note that all the contained accident data comes from police reports, so this data does not include minor incidents.



## Inspiration

How has changing traffic flow impacted accidents?
Can we predict accident rates over time? What might improve accident rates?
Plot interactive maps of changing trends, e.g. How has London has changed for cyclists? Busiest roads in the nation?
Which areas never change and why? Identify infrastructure needs, failings and successes.
How have Rural and Urban areas differed (see RoadCategory)? How about the differences between England, Scotland, and Wales?
The UK government also like to look at miles driven. You can do this by multiplying the AADF by the corresponding length of road (link length) and by the number of days in the years. What does this tell you about UK roads?



# Conclusions

In this study we intercept the factors of the accidents in the traffic and we had some conclusions. The traffic accidents have a decreasing trend through years, accidents does not depend on the traffic flow but the traffic rules, signs, authorised persons. The data we have does not gives us necessary informations for the accidents ratings relate factors, we can not make strong predictions about the accident severity to. City centers have the most number of accidents, especially London. Rural areas have less number of accidents and it sounds pretty logical. Most of the accidents have similar situations, some factors are raid to the other factors and those factors are generally includes normal conditions. So accidents are a part of our daily life, they does not depend special conditions.
